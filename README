This project involves idenitfying solid-like clusters of atoms within the trajectories of CMD simulations.
The included codes will locate and define the clusters (nuclei) of solid atoms in supercooled lammps simulations of liquids.
clusters.f95 is the standard code
make.sh is a short, temporary make file for the Archer2 system
test.f95 is the same as clusters.f95 but also defines the surrounding liquid composition of clusters.
